# SAT_Solver
 This project implements a complete DPLL-based SAT Solver with real-time decision tree visualization. It generates random CNF formulas and solves them using the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm enhanced with:  Unit Propagation  Pure Literal Elimination  Backtracking with Visual Logging  As the solver progresses, each decision and conflict is tracked and visualized in a graph using networkx, helping learners and researchers better understand SAT solving logic and decision-making paths.  This tool is ideal for:  Educational use in logic and computational theory  Visual debugging of SAT-solving logic  Experimenting with heuristic techniques in constraint satisfaction problems
